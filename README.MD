This is my 6th version of this project, made to show my ability to create a PWA(Progressive Web App)

## Getting started

1. Use `npm install` to install all needed dependencies

2. You need to connect to mongoDB on the server.

3. Create a `.env` file with a jwt secret key

4. Use `npm start` in the root directory to start the application
