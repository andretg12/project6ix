This is my 6th version of this project, made to show my ability to create a PWA (Progressive Web App).

The above image were the Lighthouse audit results of my app before I turned it into a PWA and below you'll find the Lighthouse Audit for after.

## Getting started

1. Use `npm install` to install all needed dependencies

2. You need to connect to mongoDB on the server.

3. Create a `.env` file with a jwt secret key

4. Use `npm start` in the root directory to start the application

## PWA Capabilities

If you go the website in the description of the repo on a mobile device, you'll find the add to home screen option, after you follow the steps youll encounter this icon in your homescreen
